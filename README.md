# GeoNet-
A geographical social network that allows residents of Ventura County to create a profile, connect with other users, and get some interesting information such as phone numbers and directions to friends' houses.

This social networking program is very geographically-focused. Its primary purpose for a user creating a profile is to see who other people on the network are friends with, to get directions from person A's town to person B's town. The distances from person to person and city to city are based on the actual layout of Ventura County, CA.
